How to Use intel_gpu_tools.
===========================

Intel-gpu-tools – freedesktop (http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/app/intel-gpu-tools/ )

A) Steps to get started :
	1.   Git clone http://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/xorg/app/intel-gpu-tools.git
	2.   Yum install python3*                 
			##(Remark: for FC18 the installed python version will 
				be 3.3.x meanwhile 3.2.x for FC16)
	3.	alias python='python3' (type “python” command on the console to ensure 
		that we are using 3.X interpreter instead of 2.7.3 ) –
	4.  echo "alias python='python3'" -> it is always best to place this in the .bashrc 
		so that we do need to set this always
	5.  install libdrm-2.3.39
	6.  install xorg-macro >=1.17
	7.  Get into intel-gpu-tools then :
		$  ./autogen.sh PYTHON_LDFLAGS="-lpython3.3m" 
				( use lpython3.2mu for FC16 | use “lpython3.3m” for FC18 )
			   ## Remark: the installed python libraries are located in /usr/bin
		$  Make


B) Read and write VLV MMIO registers
-   Go to tools then execute intel_reg_read or intel_reg_write .

	Example: ./intel_reg_read 0x001e000c (added: 1800000 offset in accordance to b-spec)
		$./intel_reg_red 0x001e000c
		0x1E000C: 0x42903FF
     
-   Alternatively:
	Get into quickdump: use reg_access

    Example: python reg_access.py 0x001e000c (added: 1800000 offset in accordance to b-spec)
		$ python reg_access.py 0x001e000c
		$ 0x42903ff
      

 

C) 	Quickdump: Intel-reg-dumper is going to be replaced by quick_dump tool  near future 
	(for future platform). However, intel-reg-dumper is still going to be kept over 
	there just handle all the legacy stuffs (SNB platform…) At it’s heart, quick dump 
	is simply a basic text parsing thingy which plugs into into intel-gpu-tools to do 
	something similar to inte-reg-dumper. The format of the register definition files is very open.  
-	Getting stated with quick dump:
	1.  Type python
	2.  Type: python <PATH>quick_dump.py –a –b (to get all the VLV specific registers)
	3.  Type: python <PATH>quick_dump.py –a       (VLV specific registers + all other base registers)
	4.  Type: python <PATH>quick_dump.py –-help ( for help menu)
 
 
-	Alternatively:
	1.	Get into quickdump
	2.  Masked out #os.chdir(os.path.dirname(sys.argv[0])) – as shown as below
 
	FILE:< quick_dump.py >
 
	3.  Type: python quick_dump.py –a –b (to get all the VLV specific registers)
	4.  Type: python quick_dump.py –a       (VLV specific registers + all other base registers)
	5.  Type: python quick_dump.py –-help ( for help menu)
 
                                   
 
D)   Note: Other functionality files within similar tools folder may or may not be working properly on VLV specific platform in tools folder.
